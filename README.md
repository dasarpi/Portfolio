# Danny's Diner
Here adding my first Sql based Project - Danny wants to his customer visiting pattern, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him to deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.
He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.
